# Anonica
This is a game I made for my Introduction to Game Design course at Carleton University.

# Description
Bits of data have gone missing from the Canadian Government’s files, and it is suspected that the American hacker group, Anonica, is responsible.  As the expert computer scientist you are, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is trusting you with the task of protecting the rest of the data.  In order to stop the data from going into the hands of Anonica, you must return each bit to their respective space in memory, known as a “Gigabyte.”  Data sprites will be constantly spawning and moving around the map, and will be attracted to the Gigabyte that is currently “turned on.”  The data sprites must move to the correct Gigabyte to be saved, or it will be stolen by Anonica.  The goal of the game is to stop Anonica from stealing all of the data by returning it to each respective Gigabyte.  Data in this game is represented by different coloured sprites moving around the game map, and is stolen if any go into the wrong space in memory.
